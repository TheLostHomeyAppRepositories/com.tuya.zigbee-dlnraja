# üöÄ com.tuya.zigbee ‚Äì Functional Vision & Global Architecture

---

## üéØ Project Objective

Create the most complete, automated, and resilient solution to integrate, maintain, and evolve all Tuya Zigbee devices on Homey, with:
- **Universal support** (dynamic drivers, multi-source extraction, AI benchmarking)
- **Total automation** (restoration, backup, CI/CD, multilingual docs, benchmarking, reporting)
- **Transparency & monitoring** (web dashboard, logs, changelog, real-time status)
- **AI-first** (driver generation, docs, icons, translation, benchmarking, suggestions)

## üõ†Ô∏è Task Architecture & Automations

### 1. Multi-level Restoration & Backup
- Automatic backup at every critical action (merge, push, PR, cron): full ZIP + lite version (drivers/scripts only) to cloud and secondary repo.
- Cross-platform restoration script (PowerShell, Bash, Docker, GitHub Action): replaces each file, smart fallback, detailed logs, alerts on failure.

### 2. Historical Extraction & Reinjection
- Analysis of git history (all branches, commits, forks) to restore any deleted or overwritten artifact.
- Additive merge into main and beta branches, with detailed loss/restore report.

### 3. CI/CD Automation & GitHub Actions Workflows
- Key workflows: CI, deploy, repair, bench-ia, backup, translate, beta-sync, autofix, release-pr, labeler, welcome, stale, etc.
- Triggers: push, PR, merge, cron, manual, error.
- Logs, badges, notifications, secrets management.
- Automatic fallback on error.

### 4. Device Table & Web Dashboard
- Auto-generation from drivers, AI bench, issues/PR, Z2M/HA parsing.
- Dynamic table (React/HTML), badges, auto icons, links to docs/spec/issues.
- Auto-update on each merge/cron, generated changelog, sorted by name, brand, type, implementation, date, status.

### 5. Multilingual (EN/FR, extensible)
- README, docs, dashboard generated in English and French (Crowdin/DeepL/Claude/GPT).
- Automatic translation via workflow, language badge, auto-translated section in PR/issues.

### 6. Advanced Bot Management
- Automatic review, autofix, release notes, welcome, stale/labeler, CodeQL.
- Auto-merge if CI OK, auto-cleanup of issues/PR, security scan at each build.

### 7. Universal Restoration & Deployment Scripts
- deploy.ps1 / rebuild_project.sh: full local rebuild/restore, tests, device table generation, README update, ZIP backup, detailed logs.
- Smart fallback (wget raw, API, backup, git blob history).
